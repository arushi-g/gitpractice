## The Coming Software Apocalypse

This great [article](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/09/saving-the-world-from-code/540393/) in the Atlantic was an eye-opener when I first read it a year ago and I've returned to it multiple times. 

The article opens with a story of how the 911 line in Washington State was down for 6 whole hours one night in April 2014. The government scrambled to figure out the issue and when they finally did, they realized that it was coming from the server that ran the 911 line. The programmers who wrote it had set a running counter for the calls, and picked an arbitrary number in the millions as the limit. The counter surpassed that number that day, and the server could no longer take any calls.

This story highlights how wrapped up software is in every part of our lives, including our most important systems - and therefore, how important it is for programmers to get it right. A silly small decision of what number to set a counter at put the lives of Washington's residents at stake, and the programmers hadn't even anticipated the problem occuring. Software systems aren't tangible the way our old systems used to be, which the author posits is the major problem. Software failures are not failures of the program (the computer did exactly what it was told), but rather of the programmers - who can't be expected to perfectly imagine every scenario.

The author goes on to describe efforts to make programming more like creating physical systems, in order to avoid issues like this. I haven't seen anything like this in my classes or my internships, though it seems vastly important, especially for critical systems. I hope to see more work on improving the process of software creation, as it becomes increasingly important in today's world.

Interesting article, clearly makes a point in that software engineering is important in almost every industry in the comtemporary society.

A great article highlighting the importance of software in today's society. Therefore, we, as programmers, must understand how critical it is to be precise in our development and maintenance of code as even the smallest errors may cause huge disturbances in the functionality of our everyday lives.
